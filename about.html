        <p>Hello! I am Roberto Morales, I am from Sonora, Mexico, 31 years old, I studied Mechatronics Engineering at the Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Hermosillo, now I am studying Web Developer at Cornerstone International College in Vancouver, BC. I love sports, especially baseball and snowboarding, I have been playing baseball since I was 10 years old and here I am on 3 teams, hopefully next year in the season my friend and I will put 2 teams, one fast pitch and the other pitch slow. that this is mixed (Women and Men), with snowboarding I just started 2021 and I am waiting for this season to practice again, but now I do workout at night after school, I have been doing this for 7 years and as a hobby. I make cocktails as a bartender/mixologist. I have my own set of tools and alcohol. Next year when I finish school I really want to practice playing the piano, this is something that I wanted all my life but there was no one in my city at that time. </p>
