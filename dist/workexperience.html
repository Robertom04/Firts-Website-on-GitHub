        <p>• Development of mechanical parts from scratch to finish good.</p>
        <p>• Design 3D parts from client designs, this based on blueprint and converted to the company's own language.</p>
        <p>• Planning of labor track selecting each operation from the arrival of the raw material, how it will be machined in each operation and the selection of each machine (cnc lathe, cnc milling machine, waterjet, IDM, manual machines, etc).</p>
        <p>• Design and creation fixtures for parts to properly machine the part according to its machining stage, giving assembly instructions for a better set-up.</p>
        <p>• Development of programs CNC (Lathe, Mill, Waterjet, EDM).</p>
        <p>• Set-ups of the machines to machine the part numbers.</p>
        <p>• Assure first machining from the development of part as the developer himself performs the first set-ups and machining to solve the details and be able to provide better work instructions and advice.</p>
        <p>• Follow up manufacturing processes of parts until delivery production.</p>
        <p>• Troubleshooting in programs or machines during their development or in regular production, providing new ideas, solutions or more specific instructions.</p>
        <p>• Parts development improvements and time savings observing the behavior of the operations, both their set-ups and the machining and handling of the operators themselves.</p>
